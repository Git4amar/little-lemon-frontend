# Little Lemon Restaurant - Responsive Web Application

## Client's business concern

The owners of Little Lemon have learned that their customers are frustrated, that they can't easily reserve a table on their website. They want to resolve this issue so that they can plan staff and supplies, not solely rely on walk-ins, and give their diners a great experience.

## My Role in resolving Little Lemon's concerns

### Step 1

I start helping the owners of Little Lemon achieve this goal by applying the principles of UX UI, user experience and user interface, to the current website's functionality for reserving a table.
